# Cloud Support Engineer/DevOps Support Engineer INTERVIEW PREPARATION
The below guide should prove to be useful if you're interested in Cloud Support/DevOps profile in any organisation. The profile designation can vary from company to company but the gist is you work on customer problems, troubleshoot and provide a solution.

The interview mostly focused on domain knowledge of Operating System and Computer Networks. If you're a fresher, basic cloud knowledge studied in college curriculum should be enough. Apart from this personal projects can give you some edge over technologies you explored in college. 

In case you're experienced candidate, questions can be specific to previous domain you've worked on.
For example: If you're applying in database domain, then you should know troubleshooting in databases, best practices one should follow, kind of databases and how to choose between multiple options, etc.

Interview process generally consists of online test and F2F interviews. Online test can contains MCQ on core CS concepts and aptitude. Apart from this there could be programming questions with easy/medium difficulty.

3. Wifi connectivity is slow
4. Website is accessible by entering DNS but not with uri(e.g. working with 52.22.22.22 but not with google.com)

### Programming Questions
As this is DevOps role, the questions should be of easy difficulty level.
In my judgement, this should be easy question - swap two numbers with help of only two variables

### Behavioral Questions
Apart from technical questions, you should prepare for behavioral questions on how you'll handle or react on different kind of situations.

### Tips and Suggestions
* I combined multiple topics in above list of topics. In interviews, generally you're evaluated on how well you understand the system and not just memorizing the definitions.
